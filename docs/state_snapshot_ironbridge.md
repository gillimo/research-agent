==========================

Timestamp
- 2025-12-29

Summary
- Local-first Martin + Librarian architecture in place with cloud sanitization guardrails.
- CLI supports chat, plan, approvals, sandboxing, tool ledger, session resume, and task queue.
- Rich-ish UX via readline + Rich panels; still missing a full TUI shell.
- Tests green.

Focus
- Close remaining UX parity gaps and harden Librarian IPC trust boundary.
